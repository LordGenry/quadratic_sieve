Project in High Performance Computing class at EPFL. The purpose of the project is examination of parallelization properties for quadratic sieve algorithm of Carl Pomerance. 
Author of the project is Aleksa Stankovic. For setup of parameters look into init.cpp file.

For compilation call:
make

Project can be run using
mpi-exec -n $NUMBER_OF_CORES main

or by calling sieve.slurm script with sbatch command
